## What I learned with this project?

This is a simple application, and the first one with some functionality. I learned how to work with stateful widgets to update the screen as needed.

I also learned about the ```Expanded``` widget, which is extremely important when we are developing applications that can be in different devices with different screen sizes.

More importantly, I remembered myself how to use the Dart language to implement some logic. It was fun.
